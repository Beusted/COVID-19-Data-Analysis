# COVID-19 Data Analysis
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
  
  Programmed in SQL, I aimed to explore various aspects of the pandemic's impact across different countries and continents. The script performs several operations, including calculating total and new COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates. It uses aggregation functions to analyze infection and death rates, comparing them to the population size of different regions. Additionally, it includes the use of common table expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, and views to manage and prepare the data for further analysis, particularly in visualizing vaccination percentages across populations. The code segments emphasize grouping data by location and date to track trends over time.
